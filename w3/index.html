                <br>   
                <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Andrew Castro</strong>! I was born and raised in <em>Rhode Island.</em> However, my dad is from Guatemala. My mother was born and raised and Rhode Island as well. But, her parents (my grandparents)
                    are from Portugal (São Miguel). Ethnically I am Portuguese, Filipino, Spanish, and "technically" Chinese. But I think that would be too distant to count at this point. As for languages- I can only
                    fluently speak in English. However, I can understand the majority of what my family says in Portuguese, specifically their dialect. I can read and write in Korean/한글, but my vocabulary and grammar
                    are too elementary to be considered anywhere near fluent...
                    
                <br><br>
                I work part time as a Door Dash driver, because it's the most flexible part-time job to have, while being a full-time college student. I'm able to set my own hours, but sadly there will always be the 
                "best" hours to work (Lunch, Dinner, Breakfast)- just due to demand. Most of my free time I spend playing video games, mostly MMORPGs (FFXIV!). I got into MMORPGs because my first PC video game I ever played was
                a free to play social MMORPG called Free Realms (2009-2014), by Sony Online Entertainment (now DayBreak Games). I was in a guild called Mystic Mayhem, and am still friends with many of them today.
                
                <br><br>Well... That's all for my bio page. Bye!</p>
               </p>
