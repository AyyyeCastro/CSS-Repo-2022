         <h2>My Bio</h2>
         <img src="images\Spongebob_Smart.gif" alt="Dumb Patrick">

         <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Andrew Castro</strong>! I was born and raised in <em>Rhode Island.</em> However, my dad is from Guatemala. My mother was born and raised and Rhode Island as well. But, her parents (my grandparents)
            are from Portugal (São Miguel). Ethnically I am Portuguese, Filipino, Spanish, and "technically" Chinese. But I think that would be too distant to count at this point. As for languages- I can only
            fluently speak in English. However, I can understand the majority of what my family says in Portuguese, specifically their dialect. I can read and write in Korean/한글, but my vocabulary and grammar
            are too elementary to be considered anywhere near fluent...
            
            <br><br>
            I work part time as a Door Dash driver, because it's the most flexible part-time job to have, while being a full-time college student. I'm able to set my own hours, but sadly there will always be the 
            "best" hours to work (Lunch, Dinner, Breakfast)- just due to demand. Most of my free time I spend playing video games, mostly MMORPGs (FFXIV!). I got into MMORPGs because my first PC video game I ever played was
            a free to play social MMORPG called Free Realms (2009-2014), by Sony Online Entertainment (now DayBreak Games). I was in a guild called Mystic Mayhem, and am still friends with many of them today.
      
         <br><br>Well... That's all for my bio page. Bye!</p>  
         <hr> 

         <p><br><i>Enjoy my favorite FFXIV soundtrack. (potential zone spoilers)</i></p>
